## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (or a free cloud DB like [Neon](https://neon.tech))

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskmanager.git
cd taskmanager
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/taskmanager
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-here
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000** — database tables are created automatically on first run.

## 🌐 Deploying to Railway

1. **Push to GitHub** — `git push origin main`
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Click **+ New → Database → Add PostgreSQL** — Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically
4. In your app's **Variables** tab, add:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. Railway redeploys automatically. Go to **Settings → Domains** for your live URL.

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access

Roles are **project-scoped** — you can be Admin on your own project and Member on a colleague's.

| Action | Member | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| View project & tasks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create tasks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update own tasks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update any task | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete own tasks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete any task | ❌ | ✅ |
| Invite / remove members | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edit / delete project | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
users (id, name, email, password, created_at)
projects (id, name, description, owner_id, created_at)
project_members (id, project_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
tasks (id, project_id, title, description, status, priority, assigned_to, due_date, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (cost factor 10)
- JWT tokens expire after **7 days**
- User enumeration prevented — same error for wrong email and wrong password
- All user-generated content is **XSS-escaped** before rendering
- SQL injection prevented via **parameterised queries** (`$1`, `$2` placeholders)
